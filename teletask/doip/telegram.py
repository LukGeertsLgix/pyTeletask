"""
Module for DoIP Telegrams.

This module defines classes and enums for handling Teletask DoIP (Digital over IP)
telegrams. Telegrams are the primary means of communication in Teletask systems,
and the module allows for constructing and representing these telegrams based
on various commands, functions, and settings.

Classes:
    - Telegram: Handles construction of DoIP telegrams.
    - TelegramHeartbeat: Manages the "keep-alive" telegrams for ongoing communication.

Enums:
    - TeletaskConst: Constants for Teletask system, such as START and CENTRAL identifiers.
    - TelegramCommand: Represents available Teletask commands (e.g., SET, GET).
    - TelegramFunction: Represents various functional units in the Teletask system.
    - TelegramSetting: Possible settings for functions (e.g., ON, OFF).
